# School District Analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis:
The School District File shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. The school board wants to uphold state-testing standards so they asked us to help. I have replaced the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with "NaNs" while keeping the rest of the data intact. Then, I repeated the school district analysis that I did in this module to see how these changes affected the overall analysis.
## Results:
**1. How is the district summary affected?**

The District Summary is affected because the "average math score" and "% passing math" is slighlt lower without the scores of the ninth graders from Thomas High School. With their scores the "average math" was 79 and the "% passing math" was 75%. In this picture you can see those scores are 78.9 and 74.8%, respectively.

**2. How is the school summary affected?**

Without the 9th graders at THS:

If you look close to the numbers, you can see that all of the scores for Thomas High School are now slightly lower than when the ninth graders were included. 

**3. How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?**

In the School Summary, Thomas High School still remains as the second best school for overall passing percent with and without the 9th graders score for THS.

### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
**4. Math and reading scores by grade**

With the numbers rounded to the hundreth decimal point, the school type is not affected, but if you were to look at more precise numbers, you will see that the school type is now slightly lower. 

## Summary:

After reading and math scores for the ninth graders at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs, the following four changes have been affected: school type, school size, school spending, and math/readings scores by grade.
